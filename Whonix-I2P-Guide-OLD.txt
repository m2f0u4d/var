						DISCLAIMER 
This HowTo originated Killyourtv.i2p and went offline when Kytv went MIA , so I ( Goldstein ) updated it to the Current Qubes-OS Whonix Version
(all Killyourtv services went down see http://zzz.i2p/topics/2098-all-kytv-services-down)

THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS 
If you rely on strong security dont use this yet
This Guide will change or get obsolete soon 

Guide to Run I2P inside Whonix Gateway and make it accesible via Whonix Workstation and Redirect all non i2P requests trough TOR

The Whonix site suggests running I2P on the Whonix workstation, routing all I2P traffic over Tor.
 If you care about Tor or I2P, DON'T DO THIS! It would be far better to install I2P on the Whonix gateway and acess THAT from the workstation. This guide describes one way of acheiving this...

The steps in this document have been tested with I2P 0.9.25 and Whonix-(Gateway|Workstation) running in Qubes and will likely work with future versions with minor modifications.



    
Preparation    
    
 If you plan on using two Whonix Gateways (one for I2P and Tor and one for Tor only) create a seperate Gateway ProxyVm and Workstation AppVM



Installing I2P


We'll install I2P using the Debian packages.from the 'official' I2P project's. (Kytv used to build the packages used by both (his repo and the offical )(see Disclaimer) ).

on the Whonix-Gateway Template add the I2P Repository to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/i2p.list  via

	user@host:~$ sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/i2p.list
	
Paste this into the newly created file
	
	deb http://deb.i2p2.no stable main
	
After adding the repo,download the i2p debian repo key

	user@host:~$ wget.anondist https://geti2p.net/_static/i2p-debian-repo.key.asc
	
Verify the File 

	user@host:~$ sha512sum < i2p-debian-repo.key.asc 
	
The Result should be (Note I created the Checksum after Downloading and manually Verifying it (as none was provided by I2P #todo write i2p devs to provide checksums), so you have to trust me that its sane or Verfify it Manually yourself)
	
	b08772408d32fd84ff414d241d3b78baea278b3388186d8e34aed8579c68e643868ee4d3c3f0beb8424bc1e4ac4288b335f9c28781b8282b5dda69f49dbe2922  -
	
after  Verifying add the i2p debian Key to Apt
	
	user@host:~$ sudo apt-key add i2p-debian-repo.key.asc

After adding the key, update the package lists.
	
	user@host:~$ sudo apt-get update


Now we can install I2P and its dependencies:

	user@host:~$ sudo apt-get install i2p i2p-keyring

Within a few minutes, I2P and its dependencies will be downloaded and installed.
 
 Don't start I2P yet!
 
 
Editing the firewall rules
#New  currently TESTING  Method 

Add the settings in the Whonix-Firewall (/etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf ) (Uncomment any SocksPort you dont need)

NO_NAT_USERS+=" $(id -u i2psvc)"
GATEWAY_TRANSPARENT_DNS=1
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_BOB=2827
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_TAHOE=3456
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_WWW=4444
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_WWW2=4445
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_IRC=6668
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_XMPP=7622
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_CONTROL=7650
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_SOCKSIRC=7651
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_SOCKS=7652
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_I2CP=7654
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_SAM=7656
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_CON=7657
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_EEP=7658
	
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_SMTP=7659
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_POP=7660
	
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_BOTESMTP=7661
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_BOTEIMAP=7662
SOCKS_PORT_I2P_MTN=8998
	
	
Now reload the Firewall 

	user@host:~$ sudo /usr/bin/whonix_firewall
	

I2P Cant Connect to any of the reseed servers 
Current dirty fix # This will be fixed soon

Start the Whonix-Gateway-Template open a terminal and edit the /etc/resolve.conf 

	sudo nano /etc/resolve.conf
	
change the nameserver from 127.0.0.1 to your Gateways Gateway IP (eg. FirewallVm (Open the Qubes Manager and look at the Whonix-Gateway Gateway IP)) 10.137.x.1 save.



 

Make the I2P folders persistent in the ProxyVm 
 (old Method) #works
by adding the following to /usr/lib/qubes-whonix/bind-directories

(at line 70 right under 'rw/srv/whonix/etc/tor:/etc/tor' )

'/rw/srv/whonix/etc/i2p:/etc/i2p'
'/rw/srv/whonix/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config:/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config'
'/rw/srv/whonix/usr/share/i2p:/usr/share/i2p'


(new Method)
by adding the following to  /usr/lib/qubes-bind-dirs.d/40_qubes-whonix.conf 

binds+=( '/etc/i2p' )
binds+=( '/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/' )


Changing I2P's listening interface

I2P listens for connections on 127.0.0.1. This won't work for us since we want to access I2P from the workstation. 
We'll setup I2P to listen on the gateway IP, which could be 10.137.x.10 depending on the Whonix version that you're using. Note: 
By the time we're finished here, you will be able to access I2P from the workstation via 127.0.0.1 as well.


Run this command in the Whonix-Gateway Proxyvm 

Run this in the whonix-Gateway

Paste this into a new file named i2pconfig.sh (it changes the listening ip from localhost to the Whonix-Gateway IP)

#!/usr/bin/bash
GATEWAYIP=$(cat /var/cache/qubes-whonix/whonix-ip-gateway)
echo "Your Gateway Ip is :"
echo $GATEWAYIP
sed -i "s/\(.*interface=\).*/\1$GATEWAYIP/g;s/\(.*targetHost=\).*/\1$GATEWAYIP/g" /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/i2ptunnel.config
sed -i "s/127\.0\.0\.1/$GATEWAYIP/g" /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/clients.config
echo "susimail.host=$GATEWAYIP" >> /usr/share/i2p/susimail.config
echo "Done"


run it 

	user@host:~$sudo ./i2pconfig.sh


If you want to use the included jetty for hosting eepsites, run the following to change its listening address to the gateway IP:

	user@host:~$ sed -i "s;\(<Set name=\"host\">\).*\(</Set>\);\1$(cat /var/cache/qubes-whonix/whonix-ip-gateway)\2;g" /usr/share/i2p/eepsite/jetty.xml



Installing and Configuring FoxyProxy
# all this Happens  in the Whonix-Workstation AppVM

Open the TorBrowser, go to the Tools menu, then Addons. In the Search all add-ons box, enter Foxyproxy. From the results list, install FoxyProxy Standard

Once installed, right click on the Foxyproxy Icon in the Toolbar and select Options, click on File at the Toolbar and select import Settings . Navigate to /usr/share/usability-misc/tbb-foxyproxy/foxyproxy.xml
Click on both pop-ups yes to import and to reboot the TorBrowser

Done you've imported the Foxyproxy rules now whenever you enter a i2p Url it will get send to the i2p router and the rest trough tor 



Forwarding Whonix-Workstations Ports to Whonix-Gateway local Ports

We'll set up the actual forwarding with this initscript. Save it to the Whonix-Workstation-Template copy it to /etc/init.d/i2p-whonix, set the executable bit, and enable it to run at start up.

	user@host:~$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cle4r/var/master/i2p-whonix

Verify the downloaded file

	user@host:~$ sha512sum < i2p-whonix
	
Should Output

	2e12f13c309f5a366972b7b06bb109eb351bd28ce3d90ee596c0d479648d27da9fa577a6dd8d2d35a909e6868e587e343fd056398a4b3f63931a56648262d517

	user@host:~$ sudo cp i2p-whonix /etc/init.d/i2p-whonix
	user@host:~$ sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/i2p-whonix
	user@host:~$ sudo update-rc.d i2p-whonix defaults

The initscript will forward the following ports:

    2727, BOB: BOB is an application bridge allowing non-Java clients to interact with I2P
    3456, Tahoe-LAFS port (if installed)
    4444, I2P HTTP Proxy: Used to access sites with the .i2p TLD
    4445, I2P HTTP Proxy: Used to access sites with the .i2p TLD. (As I explain on the FoxyProxy page, I change the standard eepSite tunnel to use ed25519 but use part 4445 to access sites whose I2P routers are too old to support ed25519)
    6668, Tunnel to Irc2P: Used to connect to the main I2P-only IRC network
    7622, A suggested port for XMPP, such as connecting to the the http://salt.i2p XMPP server (needs tunnel created)
    7650, I2PControl port
    7651, A suggested port for SOCKSIRC access (needs tunnel created)
    7654, the I2CP port
    7656, SAM: SAM is an application bridge allowing non-Java clients to use I2P. More information: SAMv1, SAMv2,
    7657, I2P router console: The router console is accessible in the web browser at http://127.0.0.1:7657
    7658, local 'eepsite': Each I2P installation is configured out of the box with the possibility to host one's own website (or eepsite) on the I2P network. The eepsite will not be acessible remotely unless its tunnel is started.
    7659, SMTP Proxy: Tunnel to smtp.postman.i2p. More information is available from within I2P at Postman's HQ
    7660, POP3 Proxy: Tunnel to pop3.postman.i2p. More information is available from within I2P at Postman's HQ
    7661, SMTP for I2P-Bote (if installed)
    7662, IMAP for I2P-Bote (if installed)
    8998, MTN Proxy: Tunnel to mtn.i2p2.i2p, a Monotone server.

Feel free to add (or remove) any ports for your needs. Note that any additions will require changes to /etc/whonix_firewall.d/50_user.conf on the Whonix-Gateway-Template.


Enabling and starting I2P

Run the following at a prompt on your Whonix Gateway Template

	user@host:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure i2p

When asked if I2P should run at start-up, pick yes. Keep the user as i2psvc. 
Feel free to change the memory allocation if you plan on adding a bunch of plugins or taking part in heavy-duty torrenting..


## Usage 

I2PMail

To use a mail client like Icedove or Claws, just configure SMTP for 127.0.0.1, port 7659 and POP for 127.0.0.1, port 7660.
IRC

To connect to Irc2P, just point your preferred IRC client to 127.0.0.1, port 6668. Make sure you are not going through a proxy.
Additional software

I2P related software that works fine with this set-up (any software listed here is either in my package repository, or Debian's):
				Software         Install Location       Notes
			Anoncoin         Workstation         You cannot set the proxy in the Anoncoin GUI due to a bug. Instead, set it in ~/.anoncoin/aoncoin.conf. To connect over I21P, make sure SAM is enabled.
				Git                      Either         Does not work over I2P since Git is forced to use torsocks via the uwt wrapper. Could probably disable the uwt wrapper to make it work.
		Grid-Updates         Gateway         Could also be installed on the workstation, but of course synching the server list wouldn't work
		I2P-Control             Gateway         Install the plugin from http://itoopie.i2p or http://plugins.i2p/plugins/i2pcontrol/. Shut down I2P. Edit ~i2psvc/i2p-config/plugins/I2PControl/I2PControl.conf and set i2pcontrol.listen.address=10.137.x.x
			Itoopie            Workstation         See notes for I2PControl
		I2P-Messenge    Workstation         Make sure SAM is enabled
			Monotone             Either         Both I2P and Tor work, meaning you can reach mtn://10.137.x.x:8998 and mtn://kytvi2pll2jw5gip.onion
			Syndie            Workstation         Archives on I2P will work. Archives on Tor will not without setting up privoxy or polipo.
		Tahoe-LAFS             Both               I'd advise installing on the gateway as per the instructions, setting the proxy to point to 10.152.152.10 (or whatever your Whonix-Gateway's IP is), port 4444, and installing on the workstation. On the workstation, create the directory ~/.tahoe/ and inside of it create a file called node.url with the contents of http://127.0.0.1:3456 This way you'll only run one instance of Tahoe-LAFS but you'll be able to access it from both the gateway and the workstation.

I have not had success with getting Robert to work, but to be fair I haven't tried very hard. It's likely that one needs to run a standalone BOB on the workstation. Search http://forum.i2p for hints.
Other notes

    It's been said that the Whonix dev doesn't recommend this set-up to avoid IP address leaks due to the IP address being shown at http://127.0.0.1:7657/netdb?r=. when not running in hidden mode, and that the workstation should not know what its IP is. If that's a problem, why not set a password for the router console at http://127.0.0.1:7657/configui? Or set up I2P and then disable access to the router console?
    Torrenting with I2PSnark will work, and the files will be saved on the Whonix-Gateway to /var/lib/i2p/i2p-config/i2psnark. See https://www.whonix.org/wiki/File_Transfer for information about transfering the files to your host or to the workstation. Another option would be to use libguestfs on your host.
